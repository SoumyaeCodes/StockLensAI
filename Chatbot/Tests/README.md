# Test Folder

This folder contains Jupyter Notebook files demonstrating how the system works.

## Explanation

Inside `test_Demo.ipynb`, you will find a demonstration of how a query is executed against the ChromaDB vector storage and web based answer. The example highlights a case where no documents are extracted because there are no matching documents related to the question asked.

This serves as an important scenario to understand how the system behaves when relevant vectors are not present in the database.
